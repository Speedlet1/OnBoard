# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
This is a card similar to that of Maggie's NFC card tutorial, however now with two seperate NFC circuits. It's designed so you can have seperate information on two NFC circuits, depending on what information you want to share with diffeent people, for example business vs personal contact information, or contact information vs Github/slack information. This is a business style card designed to be held by the owner, rather than being handed out enabling equally quick sharing of information without recurring costs if they aren't wanted. This board could also be used as a hand-out, just with much higher costs compared to traditional business cards.

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost?
It costs $34.14 for 5 boards, meaning a value of $6.83 per board

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
I followed the BOM from Maggie's NFC card tutorial, however rather than using the tutorial I found the functions of the different pins and recommended ways to wire them up in order to challenge myself as this is my second PCB that I am wanting to produce. Hope you like it!
